INTRODUCTION</div>
		<div>Signed,</div>
		<div>are you doing?</div>
		<div>Mr. Router</div>
		<div>and Bob, how</div>
		<div>Hello, Alice</div>
		<div>Message:</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>INTRODUCTION</div>
		<div>0011001</div>
		<div>1110011</div>
		<div>0010011</div>
		<div>1101101</div>
		<div>QUIT</div>
		<div>1001100</div>
		<div>Alice: Bob, Bob! It’s your sister, Alice!</div>
		<div>Alice: I’m going overseas for a holiday!</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Bob: But oh no, Alice...</div>
		<div>Bob: How will we be able to keep in touch?</div>
		<div>Alice: Don’t worry, Mr. Router can help!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Hello, Alice! Hello, Bob!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: I’m Mr. Router, at your service!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: My job is to send and receive messages for you.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: To do this, I convert messages into packets...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: …that are made up of binary data!</div>
		<div>5</div>
		<div>1</div>
		<div>6</div>
		<div>2</div>
		<div>3</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Unfortunately, I am not perfect.</div>
		<div>4</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Sometimes, a packet may become corrupted.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: This means that a 0 in the packet may be turned into a 1...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: ...or a 1 may be turned into a 0.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: When the corrupted packet is converted back...</div>
		<div>rur,!AlcB p
</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: ...the resulting message will have errors.</div>
		<div>Bob: Oh dear, is there anything we can do to prevent this?</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Yes! We can add a parity bit to every packet of data.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: We set it so that the number of 1s in the packet is always odd.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: This is called odd parity.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: For example, the parity bit is 0 here...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: …so that the number of 1s in the packet is odd.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: For this other packet, the parity bit is 1 here...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: …so that the number of 1s in this packet is also odd!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: In this way, we can detect when a packet is corrupted...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: …because the number of 1s will no longer be odd!</div>
		<div>Alice: Wow, that’s really smart!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: We could also use even parity instead of odd parity.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: With even parity, the parity bit is set...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: ...so the number of 1s in the packet is always even.</div>
		<div>11011011</div>
		<div>11011010</div>
		<div>01101100</div>
		<div>01101101</div>
		<div>01111101</div>
		<div>01111100</div>
		<div>Message Received:</div>
		<div>Bob: Hmm, what should I do?</div>
		<div>01010110</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Okay, let me convert that packet to text!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: I’ve received the following packet...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Oops, let me ask the sender to try again.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Well, looks like that's the end of the message...</div>
		<div>Bob: Oh no, what could this mean? The message doesn’t make sense.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: It could be corrupted... Should I ask the sender to try again?</div>
		<div>Bob: Yes, please! I have to read this message!</div>
		<div>0101011</div>
		<div>Message to Send:</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Okay, let me send that packet for you!</div>
		<div>Bob: Hmm, how should the next packet be sent?</div>
		<div>or</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Oh dear, it looks like the message was not sent correctly.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: I am getting requests to send the message again.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Would you like to try again?</div>
		<div>Bob: Yes, please!</div>
		<div>SCENE 1
A Strange Message
</div>
		<div>Bob: Alice has been gone for a while now…</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Bob, Bob! I’m receiving a message from overseas for you.</div>
		<div>Bob: Oh, it must be from my sister!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Yes, but I will need your help to read the message.</div>
		<div>Bob: Really? Tell me what I need to do!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Okay, I will show you each packet that I receive.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: The last bit is the parity bit.</div>
		<div>Bob: Okay...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: You will tell me whether to accept or reject the packet.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: If the packet is valid, click “Accept”. I'll try to convert it into text!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Otherwise, click “Reject”! I will ask the sender to try again.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Are you ready to start?</div>
		<div>Bob: Yes, I think so. Let's go!</div>
		<div>NEXT ></div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Now, for me to help, you two must first decide...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: …whether you want to use odd parity or even parity.</div>
		<div>Alice: Hmm...</div>
		<div>Alice: Alright, let’s use odd parity first!</div>
		<div>Alice: This means that a good packet will always have an odd number of 1s!</div>
		<div>Bob: Got it, sister. Let’s use Mr. Router to keep in touch!</div>
		<div>Help, Bob!</div>
		<div>PROCEED</div>
		<div>has gone</div>
		<div>Report Title</div>
		<div>TRY AGAIN</div>
		<div>wrong!</div>
		<div>Something</div>
		<div>Report Text</div>
		<div>Bob: Oh no, what could this mean? Is my sister in trouble?</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: I hope not. This is so strange...</div>
		<div>Bob: Mr. Router, please help me send a message back to Alice...</div>
		<div>Bob: I need to get to the bottom of this!</div>
		<div>SCENE 2
Making Contact
</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Bob, I'm ready to send your message!</div>
		<div>Bob: Oh, thank you so much!</div>
		<div>Bob: What do I need to do?</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Well, your message for Alice is already converted into packets...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: …but I need you to set the parity bit correctly for each packet.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: There will be seven bits for each packet...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: …followed by a parity bit that is either 0 or 1.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: You will need to choose which parity bit to send.</div>
		<div>Bob: Yes, I am. Let's go!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Well, it looks like the message was sent correctly.</div>
		<div>Bob: Now we wait for a reply. I hope Alice is safe…</div>
		<div>SCENE 3
Disaster Strikes!
</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Bob, looks like I’m receiving a response!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Are you ready to help receive it?</div>
		<div>Bob: Yes, I am. Let's go!</div>
		<div>The Napper</div>
		<div>Haha, Alice</div>
		<div>strikes again!
</div>
		<div>hostage!</div>
		<div>is now my</div>
		<div>Bob: Alice is being held hostage? This is terrible!</div>
		<div>Bob: And who is "The Napper"?</div>
		<div>Mr Router: Let me search online...</div>
		<div>Mr Router: Oh dear, it looks like the Napper is a nefarious criminal...</div>
		<div>Mr Router: ...who kidnaps laptops and holds them for ransom!</div>
		<div>Bob: That dastardly villain!</div>
		<div>Bob: We must do something to help my sister!</div>
		<div>SCENE 4
Calling for Help
</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Aha, Bob!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: It looks like the Napper’s last message...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: ...was sent from a small town named Nomanisan.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: We should let the police know and get their help.</div>
		<div>Bob: That’s a great idea! Let’s do it.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: However, be aware that the police use even parity.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: This means that they expect the number of 1s in each packet...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: ...to be even instead of odd!</div>
		<div>Bob: Ah, I understand. Instead of keeping the number of 1s odd...</div>
		<div>Bob: ...this time, I keep the number of 1s even.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Are you ready to start sending the message?</div>
		<div>Bob: Good. The Napper must be stopped!</div>
		<div>SCENE 5
To the Rescue
</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Bob, I’m getting a response from the police!</div>
		<div>the tip-off!</div>
		<div>We are on</div>
		<div>Thanks for</div>
		<div>our way.</div>
		<div>Bob: Looks like our plan worked!</div>
		<div>Bob: Oh, I hope they manage to rescue Alice...</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: I’m sure it’ll be alright.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: The police might even catch the Napper too!</div>
		<div>Bob: I certainly hope so!</div>
		<div>EPILOGUE</div>
		<div>Alice: Brother, brother! I’m so happy to see you!</div>
		<div>Bob: Alice, I’m so happy to see you too! Are you hurt?</div>
		<div>Alice: Don’t worry, just a few scratches here and there.</div>
		<div>Alice: The police that you contacted were so efficient!</div>
		<div>Alice: They launched a daring rescue and caught the Napper without a sweat.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Alice! Alice! I’m so glad you’re alright.</div>
		<div>Alice: Mr. Router! Thank you so much for keeping us in touch!</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: No, your thanks should really go to parity bits.</div>
		<div>Mr. Router: Without parity bits, I could not have done my job so effectively.</div>
		<div>Bob: Yes, without parity bits, detecting corrupted packets would be hard!</div>
		<div>Alice: Alright then, a big thank you to parity bits for saving the day!</div>
		<div>All: HURRAY!</div>
